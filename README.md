# Patient-Case-similarity
Disease Prediction using KNN and SMOTE
This Jupyter Notebook implements a disease prediction system using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with hyperparameter tuning and class balancing via SMOTE. It preprocesses patient symptom and profile data, trains an optimized model, and predicts diseases for new patients with similarity analysis for top 3 possible diagnoses.
